# Ansible PHP Role

An ansible role to provision PHP in a server.

The role is packaged in a way that only the *var files* should be modified to set installation specifics.

To use just copy the *php* folder to the *roles* folder inside an ansible folder structure and add the role *php* to the playbook.
